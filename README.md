# Sightline Client

Optional NeoForge client module for CSMC that provides advanced HUD rendering, camera features, and input integrity hooks.

## Development
- Java 21
- Minecraft 1.21.11 / NeoForge 21.11.x

## Notes
This client is optional. The server plugin runs without it, but enabling it improves HUD fidelity and anti-cheat signals.

## Current Features
- Lightweight in-game HUD panel (HP/Armor/FPS/Ping).
- HUD visibility hotkey: `H` (rebindable in controls under Sightline category).
